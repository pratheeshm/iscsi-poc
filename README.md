# iSCSI POC

This project demonstrates a simple iSCSI target and initiator implementation.

## Introduction

iSCSI (Internet Small Computer Systems Interface) is a protocol that allows clients (initiators) to send SCSI commands to storage devices (targets) over IP networks. It is commonly used for storage area networks (SANs).

This proof of concept (POC) project includes:
- An iSCSI target server that listens for incoming connections and handles read and write operations.
- An iSCSI initiator client that connects to the target server and performs read and write operations.

## Running the iSCSI Target

To run the iSCSI target, use the following command:

```sh
./iscsi-poc -mode target
```

The target will listen on port 3260 for incoming connections.

## Running the iSCSI Initiator

To run the iSCSI initiator, use the following command:

```sh
./iscsi-poc -mode initiator
```

The initiator will connect to the target at `localhost:3260` and perform read and write operations.

## Example Output
